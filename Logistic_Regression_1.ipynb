        "A logistic regression model is trained on the full feature set, and the feature with the smallest coefficient (or importance score) is removed.\n",
        "This process is repeated until the desired number of features is reached or until performance metrics like cross-validated accuracy or AUC-ROC plateau.\n",
        "Regularization:\n",
        "Regularization techniques like L1 (Lasso) and L2 (Ridge) regularization automatically perform feature selection by penalizing the coefficients of irrelevant features.\n",
        "L1 regularization encourages sparsity by driving some coefficients to zero, effectively selecting a subset of the most important features.\n",
        "L2 regularization shrinks the coefficients towards zero, reducing the impact of less important features on the model's predictions.\n",
        "Feature Importance from Tree-based Models:\n",
        "Tree-based models like Random Forest or Gradient Boosting can provide estimates of feature importance based on how frequently a feature is used to split the data and how much it decreases impurity (e.g., Gini impurity or entropy).\n",
        "Features with higher importance scores are considered more informative and can be selected for logistic regression.\n",
        "This method is especially useful when dealing with high-dimensional datasets with a large number of features.\n",
        "Principal Component Analysis (PCA):\n",
        "PCA is a dimensionality reduction technique that transforms the original features into a lower-dimensional space of principal components.\n",
        "Principal components are orthogonal to each other and capture the maximum variance in the data.\n",

Over-sampling can help increase the representation of the minority class but may also introduce noise or overfitting.\n",

        "Threshold Adjustment:\n",
        "Adjust the classification threshold of the logistic regression model to better accommodate the imbalance. By lowering the threshold, the model can prioritize sensitivity (true positive rate) over specificity (true negative rate), thus capturing more examples of the minority class.\n",

        "Use ensemble techniques like bagging, boosting, or stacking with logistic regression as base estimators. Ensemble methods can help improve model performance by combining predictions from multiple models trained on different subsets of the data or with different sampling strategies.\n",
        "Anomaly Detection:\n",
        "Treat the minority class as anomalies and use anomaly detection techniques to identify them. This approach can be useful when the minority class represents rare events or outliers in the dataset.\n",
        "Algorithmic Approaches:\n",
        "Utilize algorithms specifically designed to handle class imbalance, such as balanced logistic regression or class-weighted logistic regression.\n",

        "Instead of relying solely on accuracy, use performance metrics like precision, recall, F1-score, or area under the ROC curve (AUC-ROC) to evaluate the model's performance on imbalanced datasets. These metrics provide a more comprehensive understanding of the model's ability to correctly classify examples from both classes."
