Understanding this partitioning is crucial for interpreting the results of an ANOVA and gaining insights into the sources of variation in the data.\n",
        "Understanding the partitioning of variance is essential for the following reasons:\n",
        "Hypothesis Testing: ANOVA tests whether the differences between group means are statistically significant. By partitioning the total variance into between-group and within-group components, ANOVA helps determine if the observed differences are likely due to actual group effects rather than random chance.\n",
        "Effect Size: By examining the proportion of variability explained by between-group differences (SSB/SST), researchers can assess the practical significance or effect size of the group differences.\n",

Common post-hoc tests include Tukey's Honestly Significant Difference (HSD), Bonferroni correction, Scheffé test, and Dunnett's test. The choice of post-hoc test depends on the characteristics of the data and the assumptions made. Here's an overview of some common post-hoc tests:\n",

        "Use Case:\n",
        "When we want to control the familywise error rate (overall Type I error rate) by adjusting significance levels.\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "If we have conducted multiple pairwise comparisons after ANOVA, the probability of making a Type I error increases. Bonferroni correction adjusts the significance level for each individual test to maintain an overall Type I error rate.\n",

        "When we have a control group and we want to compare other groups to the control.\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "In a drug trial, if we have a control group receiving a placebo and several experimental groups receiving different doses of a drug, Dunnett's test can be used to compare each experimental group to the control group.\n",
