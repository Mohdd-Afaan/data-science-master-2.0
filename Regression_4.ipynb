        "In traditional linear regression, the goal is to minimize the residual sum of squares (RSS), which measures the difference between the observed and predicted values. However, in Lasso Regression, an additional penalty term is added to the RSS. This penalty term is the absolute sum of the coefficients multiplied by a constant, typically denoted by lambda (Î»). The addition of this penalty term encourages the coefficients of less important features to be exactly zero, effectively performing feature selection by shrinking the coefficients towards zero.\n",

This fundamental difference results in different behaviors in terms of feature selection and the degree of regularization."

This feature selection capability is highly beneficial in situations where the dataset contains a large number of features, many of which may be irrelevant or redundant.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here are some key advantages of using Lasso Regression for feature selection:\n",
        "\n",
        "Automatic Feature Selection: Lasso Regression automatically selects the most relevant features by shrinking the coefficients of less important features to zero. This helps in reducing the complexity of the model and improving its interpretability by focusing only on the most informative features.\n",
        "\n",
        "Prevents Overfitting: By penalizing the absolute sum of coefficients, Lasso Regression helps prevent overfitting by regularizing the model. Overfitting occurs when the model learns noise from the training data, leading to poor generalization performance on unseen data. Lasso's feature selection mechanism helps in mitigating this problem by reducing the number of features and simplifying the model.\n",
        "\n",
        "Handles Multicollinearity: Lasso Regression can handle multicollinearity, a situation where independent variables are highly correlated with each other. In the presence of multicollinearity, traditional regression techniques may produce unstable and unreliable coefficient estimates. Lasso's ability to select only one variable from a group of correlated variables helps in addressing this issue.\n",
        "\n",
        "Improved Model Performance: By selecting only the most relevant features, Lasso Regression can lead to a more parsimonious model that is easier to interpret and often performs better in terms of prediction accuracy and generalization to unseen data.\n",

        "Computational Efficiency: Lasso Regression can be computationally efficient, especially when dealing with high-dimensional datasets, as it effectively performs variable selection during the optimization process."

        "Ans: Interpreting the coefficients of a Lasso Regression model is similar to interpreting coefficients in traditional linear regression, but with some additional considerations due to the regularization effect of the L1 penalty. Here's how you can interpret the coefficients:\n",
        "\n",
        "Sign and Magnitude: The sign of a coefficient indicates the direction of the relationship between the predictor variable and the target variable. A positive coefficient suggests a positive relationship, while a negative coefficient suggests a negative relationship. The magnitude of the coefficient indicates the strength of the relationship.\n",
        "\n",
        "Variable Importance: In Lasso Regression, some coefficients may be exactly zero due to the feature selection property of the L1 penalty. Coefficients that are not zero indicate the importance of the corresponding predictor variables in predicting the target variable. Variables with non-zero coefficients are considered selected by the model and are deemed important for prediction.\n",

        "Relative Importance: Comparing the magnitudes of non-zero coefficients can provide insights into the relative importance of different predictor variables in the model. Larger magnitude coefficients typically indicate stronger relationships with the target variable, whereas smaller magnitude coefficients suggest weaker relationships.\n",

        "Regularization Impact: It's important to keep in mind that the coefficients in a Lasso Regression model may be shrunk towards zero or set exactly to zero due to the L1 penalty. This regularization effect helps in feature selection by effectively excluding less important variables from the model. Therefore, interpreting coefficients in Lasso Regression involves understanding the balance between regularization and predictive accuracy."

        "Ans:\n",
        "Lasso Regression, in its standard form, is a linear regression technique and is primarily suited for linear relationships between the predictor variables and the target variable. However, it is possible to adapt Lasso Regression for non-linear regression problems through various methods:\n",
        "\n",
        "Feature Engineering: One approach is to engineer non-linear features from the original features. For example, you can create polynomial features by taking higher-order powers of the original features. Once these non-linear features are created, standard Lasso Regression can be applied to the expanded feature space.\n",
        "\n",
        "Kernel Methods: Kernel methods such as the kernelized Lasso can be used to implicitly map the data into a higher-dimensional space where it becomes linearly separable. This is achieved by replacing the dot product between feature vectors with a kernel function. Popular choices for kernel functions include polynomial kernels, Gaussian kernels (RBF), and sigmoid kernels.\n",
        "\n",
        "Piecewise Linear Approximations: For complex non-linear relationships, piecewise linear approximations can be employed. The dataset can be divided into segments, and Lasso Regression can be applied to each segment separately. This approach effectively captures non-linear relationships by fitting linear models to different regions of the data.\n",
        "\n",
        "Generalized Additive Models (GAMs): GAMs combine multiple smooth functions of predictors to handle non-linear relationships. Lasso Regression can be incorporated as a penalty term within GAMs to enforce sparsity in the model and perform variable selection while capturing non-linear effects.\n",
        "\n",
        "Ensemble Methods: Lasso Regression can be used within ensemble methods such as Gradient Boosting or Random Forests. In these techniques, Lasso Regression can be applied as a base learner, focusing on different subsets of features or instances to improve predictive performance.\n",

        "Regularization Paths: Techniques like the Elastic Net, which combines L1 and L2 regularization, can be useful for handling non-linear relationships. The Elastic Net allows for a flexible trade-off between the Lasso (L1) and Ridge (L2) penalties, making it suitable for a wider range of non-linear problems."
