        "Ans: Linear regression makes several assumptions about the data in order for its estimates and predictions to be reliable. These assumptions are crucial to ensure the validity of the model. Here are the key assumptions of linear regression:\n",
        "\n",
        "The relationship between the independent variables and the dependent variable should be linear. This means that the change in the dependent variable is proportional to the change in the independent variables.\n",
        "\n",
        "The observations in the dataset should be independent of each other. In other words, the value of one observation should not be influenced by the value of another observation.\n",
        "\n",
        "Constant variance, it assumes that the variance of errors is constant across all levels of the independent variables. In simpler terms, the spread of the residuals should be consistent as the values of the independent variables change.\n",
        "\n",
        "The residuals (the differences between the observed and predicted values) should be normally distributed. This assumption is important for the validity of statistical tests and confidence intervals.\n",
        "\n",
        "In multiple linear regression, the independent variables should not be highly correlated with each other. High multicollinearity can lead to inflated standard errors and unreliable estimates of the regression coefficients.\n",
        "\n",
        "To check whether these assumptions hold in a given dataset, several diagnostic techniques can be used:\n",
        "\n",
        "Plotting the residuals against the predicted values or the independent variables can help detect patterns or trends. Residual plots should ideally show random scatter around zero, without any discernible patterns.\n",
        "\n",
        "Statistical tests such as the Shapiro-Wilk test or visual inspections like Q-Q plots can be used to assess the normality of residuals. If the residuals are normally distributed, these tests should not reject the null hypothesis of normality.\n",
        "\n",
        "Various statistical tests such as the Breusch-Pagan test or graphical methods like plotting residuals against fitted values can be employed to assess homoscedasticity. A non-constant spread of residuals indicates heteroscedasticity.\n",
        "\n",
        "Techniques such as calculating variance inflation factors (VIFs) for each independent variable or examining correlation matrices can help identify multicollinearity. VIF values exceeding a certain threshold (commonly 5 or 10) suggest high multicollinearity.\n",
        "\n",

The intercept captures the baseline level of the dependent variable when all independent variables are absent or equal to zero.\n",

The gradient indicates the direction of the steepest ascent, so the negative gradient points towards the direction of the steepest descent.\n",
        "\n",
        "Update Parameters: The parameters are updated by taking a small step (controlled by the learning rate) in the opposite direction of the gradient. This step is multiplied by the learning rate, which determines the size of the update. The learning rate is a hyperparameter that needs to be tuned carefully since it affects the convergence and stability of the algorithm.\n",
        "\n",
        "Convergence: Steps 2 and 3 are repeated iteratively until a stopping criterion is met. This criterion could be a maximum number of iterations, reaching a predefined threshold for the change in the parameters, or achieving a satisfactory level of performance on a validation dataset.\n",
